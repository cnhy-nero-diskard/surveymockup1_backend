    'Arco Point is otherwise known as “Hole in the Wall” since a cave exists wherein one enters at 9m and exit at 18m. The cave is teeming with all sorts of fishes most of which are Cardinal fish and Sergeant Major fish. If lucky enough, one will encounter the Black-finned Snake eels, the Raggy Scorpion fish aside from the Groupers, Wrasse and Butterfly fishes.',
